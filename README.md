# MK Part Picker
A simple mechanical keyboard builder to help you select components using Java.
## Features
**Main Components of a Mechanical Keyboard**:
- Keycaps
- Mechanical Key Switches
- Plate
- PCB
- Case

Using MK Part Picker, plan your build by learning briefly about different components and adding it to a list 
with a rating for *feel*, *sound*, and *quality* after a compatibility check.

The application will focus on two things: providing information and rating a keyboard build. Beginners interested 
in building their first keyboard will be able to use this application as a single reference, as it contains information
and allows the user to plan a future build. The application will take inputs and provide information about various 
components of a keyboard; it will also be able to store chosen components to give the user and idea of how the keyboard
will feel and sound. 

This project is important to me because I have built computers and keyboards before; I have always wished that there 
was a simple application that would allow me to learn about and choose components for my project.
